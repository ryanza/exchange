  # The cache module. All Classes handling caching for this gem have to be placed here. Allows easy extension with own caching solutions
  # as shown in the example below.
  # @example Write your own caching module
  #   module Cache
  #     class MyCustomCache < Base
  #       # A cache class has to have the method "cached".
  #       # The cache Base is a singleton and forwards the method "cached"
  #       # to the instance
  #       #
  #       def cached api, opts={}, &block
  #         # generate the storage with key(api, opts[:at]) and you will get a 
  #         # unique key to store in your cache
  #         #
  #         # Your code goes here
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   # Now, you can configure your Caching solution in the configuration. The Symbol will get camelcased and constantized
  #   #
  #   Exchange.configuration.cache.subclass = :my_custom_cache
  #
  #   # Have fun, and don't forget to write tests.
